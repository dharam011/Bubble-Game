# Bubble-Game
### Game Description 

This JavaScript-based game is a simple yet engaging number-matching challenge designed to test your reflexes and accuracy. The game involves a dynamic interface where bubbles containing random numbers (from 0 to 9) continuously populate the screen. Your objective is to click on the bubble that matches a target number displayed at the top of the screen before the timer runs out.

### Key Features:

1. **Dynamic Bubble Generation**:
   - The game screen is populated with 120 bubbles, each containing a randomly generated number between 0 and 9. These bubbles are generated every time the game starts or the target number is successfully matched.

2. **Target Matching**:
   - A target number is randomly generated and displayed at the top of the screen. Your goal is to find and click the bubble that matches this number. If you successfully match the number, your score increases by 10 points.

3. **Score Tracking**:
   - The game keeps track of your score, which increases each time you correctly match the target number. Your current score is displayed on the screen.

4. **Timer-Based Gameplay**:
   - You have 60 seconds to score as many points as possible. The timer counts down from 60, and when it reaches zero, the game ends, displaying a "Game Over" message.

5. **Interactive Feedback**:
   - Every time you successfully match the target number, the score updates, and a new target number is generated, keeping the gameplay fast-paced and challenging.

### How to Play:

1. Start the game, and a grid of numbered bubbles will appear.
2. Look at the target number displayed at the top of the screen.
3. Click on the bubble that matches the target number.
4. Earn points for each correct match and try to achieve the highest score before the timer runs out.
5. When the time reaches zero, the game ends, and your final score is displayed.

This game is a great way to sharpen your quick-thinking skills while having fun. It's an ideal project for beginners to intermediate JavaScript developers looking to learn more about DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple game logic.
